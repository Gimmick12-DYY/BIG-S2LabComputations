# BIG-S2LabComputations

This repository contains two main components developed within the BIG-S2 Lab at UNC Gillings:

1. **ADRD_KG/**: A knowledge graph project for Alzheimer's Disease-related datasets and studies. This internal tool supports the lab's effort to consolidate and query open-source data on ADRD, aiming to streamline research and data access across projects.

2. **ANTs_pipeline/**: A collection of shell scripts to simplify the usage of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) for MRI image preprocessing. These scripts standardize the pipeline execution for structural neuroimaging tasks.
