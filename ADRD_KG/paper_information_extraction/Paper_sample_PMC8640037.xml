Brain RNA editing may be altered in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Here, we analyzed data from 1,865 brain samples covering 9 brain regions from 1,074 unrelated subjects on a transcriptome-wide scale to identify inter-regional differences in RNA editing. We expand the list of known brain editing events by identifying 58,761 previously unreported events. We note that only a small proportion of these editing events are found at the protein level in our proteome-wide validation effort. We also identified the occurrence of editing events associated with AD dementia, neuropathological measures and longitudinal cognitive decline in: <italic toggle="yes">SYT11</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MCUR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SOD2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ORAI2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">HSDL2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PFKP</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">GPRC5B</italic>.

Since its discovery in the human <italic toggle="yes">APOB</italic> gene in 1987<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, millions of sites have been catalogued as being edited in humans. A study of B cells from 27 individuals identified &gt;10,000 exonic sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>; an investigation with six tissues in three healthy individuals catalogued 3,041,422 sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>; and the most recent analysis of 8551 samples covering 53 body sites from 552 individuals reported 408,580 RNA editing events across the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The most common form of RNA editing is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing executed through Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins. The three major genes encoding ADAR proteins are <italic toggle="yes">ADAR1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ADAR2</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ADAR3</italic>. ADAR-related RNA editing has been associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Evidence is mounting that there may be a link between RNA editing and neuropathological traits, and ADAR2 protein has an essential role in murine brain development. In humans, a recent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) study of human hippocampus samples showed significantly higher gene expression in six Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) cases compared to six normal controls for <italic toggle="yes">ADAR3</italic>, but not <italic toggle="yes">ADAR1</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">ADAR2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Also, AD patients have been reported to have significantly lower levels of RNA editing at 14 re-coding sites in 11 genes, where the editing process changes the amino acid sequence of the targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Half of these sites were discovered previously with targeted sequencing measurements in fewer than 30 AD cases and controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Although there is a growing set of reference brain RNA editing sites, there has been no full genome-scale study to systematically analyze those events in relation to AD or to assess which pathologic processes (amyloid or Tau) or endophenotypes of AD may be associated with changes in gene editing. Here, we have conducted the largest genome-wide human brain study to date, creating a resource which identifies RNA editing events in 1865 samples across 9 brain regions from 1074 subjects; they are being made available through the AD Knowledge Portal website where our source RNA-seq data is already available (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Data">https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Data</ext-link>). Based on our unique data which include multiple brain regions and proteomes from the same subjects, we are able to study the mapping of RNA editing across different brain regions as well as the extent to which coding events affect the proteome. In addition, with our sample size of 1074 independent subjects (Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) with brain tissue data, we return significant results from our rigorous statistical methodology that produced our association signals for AD (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of our&#160;analyses.</title><p>This diagram outlines the different datasets used in our report and the different analyses that were performed.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="d32e749" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="41467_2021_27204_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of RNA editing events across different datasets</title><p id="Par6">The majority of RNA editing events are the canonical A-to-I editing types, which are shown as the A-to-G and T-to-C editing types (&#8805;90%) and the C-to-T and G-to-A types (5%).

We have identified 112,779 frequent A-to-I RNA editing events, which are defined as those events with frequency &#8805;10%, across the ten datasets, and 58,761 (52%) of them are not reported before (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

The majority of the frequent RNA editing events exist in &#8805;2 brain regions (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) (65%, 72%, and 40% for the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB), and Mayo clinic RNAseq study (MAYO) datasets). We define the RNA editing level as the ratio of the edited allele to the total (reference&#8201;+&#8201;edited allele) allele count, and most subjects have an overall RNA editing level (the average editing level across all of the identified frequent RNA editing events within each sample from each subject) that is lower than 50% (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref><bold>)</bold>. The mean RNA editing level per individual is 37.5% for ROSMAP subjects, 42% for MSBB subjects, and 38% for MAYO subjects. However, there may be variation in the average editing level among brain regions, as we see (1) a greater editing rate in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) than in the anterior cingulate cortex (AC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the ROSMAP multi-region study, (2) a reduced editing rate in BM36 than in the other 3 brain regions (BM10, 22, and 44) in the MSBB study, and (3) a greater level of editing in cerebellum (CBE) than in the temporal cortex (TCX) in the MAYO dataset. In terms of the total number of frequent RNA editing events called within each subject, there may be also be a region-specific difference, showing, in general, less editing events in PCC, BM22, and TCX compared to the other regions within each of the datasets (ROSMAP, MSBB, and MAYO) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

With the 171 ROSMAP subjects (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, left), we used the RNA-seq dataset to identify 294 re-coding RNA editing events.

The remaining 47 re-coding events (16%) are found at higher frequency (&#8805;10%) in the RNA data, and 6 out of these 47 events were also identified in the proteomic dataset. More specifically, the 294 re-coding events found in the RNA data are predicted in silico to yield 459 unique tryptic peptides. From the 373 unique low-frequency predicted&#160;tryptic peptides, 4 peptides were detected within the proteomic dataset. From the 47 frequent re-coding events leading to 86 unique&#160;predicted peptides, 8 peptides were detected in the proteomic dataset. As a result, there are 13 unique tryptic peptides encoded by 10 RNA re-coding events identified in the proteomic datasets.

With this sample size, we double the current reference of sites where RNA editing takes place in the human brain (available through the Synapse portal: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22335108">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22335108</ext-link>) and have identified those present in the aging brain. Among the small proportion of sites where the editing event alters the coding sequence of a protein (0.2% of sites), we were able to recover some of the alternative alleles at the protein level in the same individuals as well as in an independent proteomic dataset, extending prior observations that such RNA editing events have a downstream effect. However, most of the proposed re-coding events were not observed at the protein level. Our sample size also allows us to perform an association analysis of RNA editing events in relation to AD and AD-related traits. Importantly, we find reproducible alterations of specific RNA editing events in the context of AD. This is similar to our recent report of reproducible splicing alterations in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and the broader narrative of specific disruptions in RNA maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and in the epigenome in relation to AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Our list of top genes associated with AD does not overlap with that from the genetic studies of AD, and none of the RNA editing events located in the AD relevant genes reported by the genetic studies reached a genome-wide significance threshold (Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), suggesting that changes in RNA editing in AD are unlikely to be related to genetic risk factors or to affect the same targets. Focusing on the RNA editing component explored in this manuscript, two of the editing events associated with AD dementia stand out: (1) the edited site in the 3&#8242;-UTR of <italic toggle="yes">SYT11</italic> which appears to influence SYT11 protein level, and (2) the <italic toggle="yes">ORAI2</italic> 3&#8242;-UTR editing event which is associated with multiple diagnostic and intermediate traits, allowing us to propose where, in the causal chain of events leading to AD, RNA editing may have an effect for this gene.</p><p id="Par19"><italic toggle="yes">ORAI2</italic> encodes the calcium release-activated calcium modulator ORAI, which inhibits the function of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels by mediating store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) in many cell types, including murine naive T cells, neutrophils, astrocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophage as well as human fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

We found that those subjects carrying the editing event have a significantly lower protein level of SYT11, perhaps because of reduced RNA stability, or tRNA codon bias. Our RNA editing study links <italic toggle="yes">SYT11</italic> to the narrative of altered vesicular formation that has emerged from AD genetic studies, and to potential synapse loss, which is the strongest correlate of dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">We also identified three mitochondrial-related proteins with AD associations: <italic toggle="yes">SOD2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">MCUR1</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PFKP</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">SOD2</italic> encodes superoxide dismutase 2, a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that scavenges oxygen radicals.

Our findings may indicate the relevance of microglia to AD pathologies with an intermediary role of RNA editing level.</p><p id="Par23">Although we have a large sample size, we are limited by not having entirely identical brain regions for the meta-analysis (DLPFC, BM44, and TCX); however, these are all neocortical regions. The study may also&#160;have a bias towards aged samples. Further, our study still has moderate statistical power, illustrated by the fact that more sites emerge from the meta-analysis. The large number of editing events in the cerebellum, which is essentially devoid of pathology in AD suggests that many of these events may be inconsequential in AD pathology. We also&#160;did not adjust for cell-type proportion of the brain tissues in our analyses. Post hoc checking for the top disease-associated RNA editing events, their disease associations were attenuated to some extent but remained significant after adjusting for the estimated proportion of neurons derived from a neuron-specific module of co-expressed cortical genes. This attenuation may be partially driven by the smaller sample size available for this neuron-adjusted analysis or the potential confounding effects of neuron proportion. In addition, total read counts do not affect the results. Our autopsy-based, cross-sectional study design also prevents us from formally demonstrating causality. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry-based proteomic methodologies have technical factors which hinder the complete quantification and identification across samples, and they are subject to ion suppression and interference such that that there is a possibility of no identification of a peptide present in the highly complex input peptide mixture for total brain proteome. This is consistent with the idea that absence of evidence for a peptide in mass spectrometry does not allow the inference or an interpretation that such a result is evidence of absence of that peptide in the cortex. And, the reference proteomic database of 17,112 peptide sequences incorporated the situation when multiple RNA editing events happen at the same time but did not include consideration of genetic variation, as such an inclusion would inflate false discovery due to increasing numbers of decoy peptides and a more intense computational requirement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The low frequency of observation of peptide evidence for coding changes due to RNA editing in ROSMAP cases with paired RNA sequencing may reflect sparse, dissimilar editing events for the specific patient proteomes combined in TMT batches of mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The batch-wise mixtures of individuals in TMT-based quantitative proteomics dilute any peptide found in only one or a small subset of samples within a TMT batch, warranting development of additional approaches with better sensitivity for RNA-editing re-coded peptides at the individual level, e.g., selected reaction monitoring. Finally, we elected not to tally, analyze, or comment on the role of infrequent editing events (frequency&#8201;&lt;&#8201;10%) as these are more likely to include sequencing errors.</p><p id="Par24">In conclusion, we have significantly expanded the reference of RNA editing sites where editing occurs in the brain, and we have made this reference available through the AD Knowledge Portal data sharing platform: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22335108">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22335108</ext-link>.

The data matrix is then log<sub>2</sub>-transformed, and each log<sub>2</sub>(ratio) is adjusted by subtraction of sample (column)-wise median log<sub>2</sub>(ratio) for all proteins. Then, ratios are anti-logged and multiplied by the protein (row)-wise geometric mean extracted before Eq.&#160;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> was executed. This process is iterated until convergence. The use of median polish ensures that the reduction of variance is robust to outliers while the overall algorithm preserves biological variance, and outliers, given that batches have been randomized to not confound batch with diagnosis or other biological traits. The above algorithm is applied only to the matrix culled of peptides that have &#8805;50% missing values across all batches, and all editing-specific peptides regardless of missingness. The first-term denominator was restricted to pooled global internal standard channels (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;2) in each TMT batch, and the second term to all individual case samples (non-internal standard).</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Outlier removal and regression for covariates</title><p id="Par57">Prior to regression, outlier removal was performed essentially as implemented in Oldham&#8217;s &#8216;SampleNetworks&#8217; v1.06&#8201;R script as previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Twenty-one of 360 case samples were flagged as outliers with sample connectivity beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean. Bootstrap regression of the remaining 339-case-sample TMT reporter abundance matrix was performed, explicitly modeling case status category while removing covariation with age at death, gender, and PMI. Given the relative quantitation peptide data we have, it is not possible to calculate edited/total abundance, where summing total abundance from edited and unedited peptides is not correct due to differential ionization efficiency of the distinct peptides. So, we calculated the value of edited/non-edited ratio (Table&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) because relative abundance as a ratio of sample TMT reporter abundance divided by that for the same peptide from internal standard is free of effects due to differential ionization, whereas comparison of relative abundance ratios is only possible across samples and not across different peptides, since division of sample peptide abundance by the internal standard peptide abundance abrogates different magnitudes of the signal for different peptides. The protein-level quantitation came from the standard Uniprot reference database entries and it does not incorporate the peptide quantitation of edited variant peptides, which match only to parts of the 17,112 non-Uniprot protein entries in our custom database.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Proteomic dataset of The Banner Sun Health Research Institute (Banner) study</title><p id="Par58">This study includes 201 (101 cognitively normal controls and 100 AD cases) postmortem brain tissue samples of the DLPFC from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute&#8217;s Brain and Body Donation Program.

The PHFtau are identified by molecularly specific immunohistochemistry (antibodies to abnormally phosphorylated Tau protein, AT8) and cortical density (per mm<sup>2</sup>) is determined using systematic sampling. The &#946;-amyloid protein was identified by molecularly specific immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis to obtain a value of percent area of cortex occupied by &#946;-amyloid protein. The neuritic plaque burden is determined by microscopic examination of silver-stained slides from 5 regions of midfrontal cortex, midtemporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus (4 or more regions area needed to calculate).
